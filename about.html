                                            Passionate practitioners understand what an amazing privilege it is to work with young children and with this privilege comes a significant responsibility. Working in an early years setting can be hugely rewarding but can also be demanding and stressful. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This website has been designed to be both practical and accessible and whilst valuing what you bring to your work with children each and every day. there is an opportunity for you to consider what you do each day, and it will affirm for you why it is so important to ‘get it right’ for children. The website will host relevant and inspiring resources. It will share perspectives, thoughts and ideas from experts and practitioners alike.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            There is so much to appreciate about what you bring to your role each and every day. This is not about asking you to make huge changes to your practice, but rather to take relief from knowing that there are things that you can begin to add to or take out of your day that will make the biggest difference to the lives of children.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            A commitment to making a difference in the lives of children inspired Avril and Michele to create The Passionate Practitioner: How to Transform and Inspire Your Early Years Practice. This website will complement the book and remind you that as a professional working with young children is not simply following guidance and implementing theory, it is about your commitment to young children, your expertise and your passion.

								<h1> About the authors of The Passionate Practitioner's Handbook</h1>
                                <p>Michele Doull changed career 17 years ago and began 
                                    a journey to understand and appreciate the needs of our 
                                    youngest children and the adults who work tirelessly with 
                                    and for them. Getting it right for both children and adults 
                                    drives Michele’s professional practice and she is committed 
                                    to encouraging adults to truly hear the voice of children; 
                                    listening for the words that are felt but perhaps not able to 
                                    be spoken.
                                    Michele is a mum to two amazing sons and she and her 
                                    husband live in Central Scotland. </p>
